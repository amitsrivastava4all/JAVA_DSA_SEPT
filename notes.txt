Why u do overriding?

When some feature is coming from parent and it is outdated for child.
So child will override it , override hide the parent method.

@override - This is the Annotation, Purpose is to tell the compiler we are doing overriding.

When u override the parent method the signature must be same as parent.
void show(int x, int y); // method signature
Signature 
Method name
Method return type
Method arguments


Method Overloading â€”
Method name is same , but argument must be different.
Why u need overloading.
e.g search
search(String productName)
search(double price)
search(String productName, double price)
search(double qty, String brandName)

Overloading
1. Number of Argument can be different
2. Type of Argument can be different
3. Order of Argument can be different
